- [x] add a header to the preview panel (try to mimic atom header)

- [x] while creating playground editor, fix the grammar as 'elm'
- [ ] show errors with red background
- [ ] load .frolic files, if any
- [ ] Can save playground code as a file. Also, when the code file is loaded in the future, the playground file automatically gets loaded with it. That way, you can think of the playground code as sort of clojurescript devcards.
