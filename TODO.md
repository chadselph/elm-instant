- [x] add a header to the preview panel (try to mimic atom header)
- [x] contain: 'strict' for output container
- [x] remember the last content in playground pane, when toggling (switching between hide and show)
- [x] while creating playground editor, fix the grammar as 'elm'
- [x] install language-elm and elm-format atom packages as dependency for installing this package (called package-deps :))
- [x] output pane does not scroll
- [x] UserCode.elm and elm-package.json keep changing on every commit. Need a way to make them static.
- [x] map playground code to file name
- [ ] A single expression erroring out should not show error in the whole preview section. Alternate solutions
    - [ ] The component returned for errorful expressions should be the error component
    - [ ] return object from compiler which has {output, error} and then the output component (preview window) shows error at the bottom in a different section
- [ ] elm-make is a big cpu hog. can't pass unchanged code expressions through elm-make again and again. Need a better cache strategy. Cache the generated js file using md5('code+filename')?
- [ ] wrap each component produced by compiler in div with 'contain: strict' style.
- [ ] can't have `rm -rf` in elm build script. Doesn't work on windows. Need to change it to rimraf.
- [ ] run compiler stuff in a web worker
- [ ] use <webview> tag to wrap the preview component. It's provided by electron to sandbox the stuff running there. Would prevent security attacks if people build apps that load remote data.
- [ ] add eslint rules (.eslintrc)
- [ ] add flow/typescript
- [ ] should be able to resize the preview pane
- [ ] show errors with red background
- [ ] load .pg (playground files extension) files, if any
- [ ] Can save playground code as a file. Also, when the code file is loaded in the future, the playground file automatically gets loaded with it. That way, you can think of the playground code as sort of clojurescript devcards.
- [ ] Preferences - allow user to add path to elm packages as a preference
- [ ] ability to install a library by giving the name (e.g. elm-lang/html). If library already available, don't do nothing
- [ ] watch files which are imported in the loaded file as well as the loaded file and reload on change of any the files files
- [ ] time traveling slider
- [ ] when user does `import module x` determine if itâ€™s in local folder. if not, do a `elm package install x` automatically
- [ ] use async await for async operations
- [ ] FIX Bug - keep getting this error `cannot read property appendChild of null`
  - looks like it happens in the elm VM
- [ ] line mapping from playground expressions to output goes for a toss in three scenarios -
    - [ ] there are statements with expressions
    - [ ] the output content wraps in more than one line
    - [ ] when there is a mixture of expressions and ui components
- [ ] might not work on windows because of folder paths (/ vs \)
- [ ] Generate tests from playground code
- [ ] For ui components, can generate tests for update function
- [ ] use [memory-fs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/memory-fs) instead of writing files
- [ ] **Frolic Lessons** - Allow creation of lessons (can start with lesson file with particular format). Allows users to go to next/previous questions etc., when a lesson is loaded
    - [ ] load frolic-lesson.json. will have the order of question files. Should have corresponding .frolic (playground) files
    - [ ] When user moves to next/previous/particular question, update json file so that next time the lesson file is loaded, start from that questions
    - [ ] jump to question number 'x'
    - [ ] Finish lesson?
    - [ ] Feedback (how many correct/wrong etc.)
    - [ ] hints
